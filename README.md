# Transfer Control in Flutter

## Break Statement

The `break` statement in Flutter is used to exit or terminate a loop prematurely. It is commonly used within loops (such as for, while, or switch-case) to exit the loop when a specific condition is met.

## Continue Statement

The `continue` statement in Flutter is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. It is commonly used within loops to skip certain iterations based on specific conditions.

## Return Statement

The `return` statement in Flutter is used to exit a function and return a value to the caller. It can be used to return a value from a function and terminate its execution, even if the function has not reached its end.

This README provides an overview of transfer control statements including break, continue, and return statements in Flutter.
